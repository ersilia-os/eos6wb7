# Antimicrobial activity prediction against Klebsiella pneumoniae from public ChEMBL data

Bioactivity prediction of growth inhibition in Klebsiella pneumoniae, trained as binary (active/inactive) classifiers from publicly available data in ChEMBL. Independent models are trained on multiple bioactivity datasets, corresponding to single-point (percent inhibition) and dose-response (MIC) assays, among others. A ranking score is provided for each model alongside a combined consensus score.

This model was incorporated on 2026-05-19.Last packaged on 2026-05-25.
